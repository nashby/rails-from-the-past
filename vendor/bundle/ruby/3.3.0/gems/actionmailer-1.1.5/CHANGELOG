      @body       = "Nothing to see here."
      @charset    = "iso-8859-1"
    end
    
    def unencoded_subject(recipient)
      @recipients = recipient
      @subject    = "testing unencoded subject"
      @from       = "system@loudthinking.com"
      @body       = "Nothing to see here."
      @encode_subject = false

    def post_notification(recipients, post)
      @recipients          = recipients
      @from                = post.author.email_address_with_name
      @headers["bcc"]      = SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR_EMAIL
      @headers["reply-to"] = "notifications@example.com"
      @subject             = "[#{post.account.name} #{post.title}]"
      @body["post"]        = post
    end

*0.4* (5)

* Consolidated the server configuration options into Base#server_settings= and expanded that with controls for authentication and more [Marten]
  NOTE: This is an API change that could potentially break your application if you used the old application form. Please do change!

* Added Base#deliveries as an accessor for an array of emails sent out through that ActionMailer class when using the :test delivery option. [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added Base#perform_deliveries= which can be set to false to turn off the actual delivery of the email through smtp or sendmail.
  This is especially useful for functional testing that shouldn't send off real emails, but still trigger delivery_* methods.

* Added option to specify delivery method with Base#delivery_method=. Default is :smtp and :sendmail is currently the only other option.
  Sendmail is assumed to be present at "/usr/sbin/sendmail" if that option is used. [Kent Sibilev]

* Dropped "include TMail" as it added to much baggage into the default namespace (like Version) [Chad Fowler]


*0.3*

* First release
